These are a set of scripts that demonstrate basic usage of the Outside.in API.

## Prerequisites

In order to run these scripts. you will need to register for an account at [developers.outside.in](http://developers.outside.in) to receive the developer key and shared secret you'll use to sign your requests.

Each script may also have dependencies that must be installed to run the script. See the individual scripts' README files for details.

## Usage

The scripts all perform the same simple task: finding the most recent stories attached to a particular location. This makes it easy to compare implementations for different languages.

The location name can be specified as pretty much any string that identifies a region in the United States. You may not use a street address, however, as the API does not support address searches at this time. Some examples of valid location names include:

* New York (or NY)
* Brooklyn, NY
* Williamsburg, NY
* 11211
