This is an example iPhone application that displays the most recent stories for a location.

Note that this example is not meant to display best practices for iPhone app development, but rather to demonstrate
a simple interaction with the Outside.in API. The interface is extremely crude, and memory management is pretty much
ignored. Use at your own risk!

## Prerequisites

Building the application requires XCode and the iPhone 4.1 SDK.

## Building

Use XCode to build the application and run it using the iPhone Simulator.

Note that if you do not provide values for the key, secret and location fields, nothing will happen on-screen when you press the Go button. However, you should see messages logged to the console.
